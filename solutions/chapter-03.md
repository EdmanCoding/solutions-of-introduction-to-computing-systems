	1. top = P-type
	2. bottom = N-type
3. Every input can be 0 or 1. So there are total of 4 pair of possibility. And those pairs can produce 2 different outcomes (0 or 1). So 2^4 = 16 possible functions are possible.
4. S
	1. A = 0, B = 0, C = 1
	2. A = 1, B = 0, C = 0
	3. A = 0, B = 1, C = 0
	4. A = 1, B = 1, C = 0
5. S
